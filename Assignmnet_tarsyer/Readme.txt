I reviewed your application for our Computer Vision Engineer job, and I'm impressed with your experience and background. I wanted to reach out and see if you were interested in hearing more and applying for a role here at Tarsyer.

As part of the recruitment process for this role at Tarsyer, we would like you take a shot at a few DL assignments. Take your time to code this and send in your answers by the weekend.

CODING ASSIGNMENTS:
Use any programming language youâ€™d like (Preferably Python and Keras or TensorFlow)

1. Implement a CNN in which the input is a noisy number and the output is a denoised number.
Use MNIST dataset. Use Gaussian distribution to add noise to the input. Plot the training & validation loss.

Build a classifier based on the trained Autoencoder. Extract the trained encoder and add some fully connected layers to classify the digits [Semi - Supervised Classification using Autoencoders]. Look up Google for more info.


2. Use this link (http://neuralnetworksanddeeplearning.com/chap1.html) and implement a neural network in Numpy.
In this link, a small number of training inputs is chosen in each batch and each data sample is processed once and the error for each sample is accummulated. Following this, back propagation is invoked.
Can you implement the back propagation in batch form?

Send in your solution as an attachment by replying to this message. If you have any questions, let me know. Good luck with the assignment!

Part1: 
AutoEncoder: Where Gaussian noised added to mnist data set.

AutoEncoder, encoder layer weight extracted and developed new architecture. Where Autoencoder layer set as trainsable=False....


Part2:Just how ML works
